In this code, I developed a simple email client in C that interacts with an IMAP server. The program can log in, retrieve, and parse emails, list subjects, and handle MIME-encoded messages. It uses socket programming to connect to the server, and I implemented various functionalities like listing emails in a folder, fetching specific emails, and parsing MIME formats to display the plain text version of an email. The client also ensures proper memory management and error handling throughout.
